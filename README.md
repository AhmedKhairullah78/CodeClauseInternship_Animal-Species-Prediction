# CodeClauseInternship_Animal-Species-Prediction

I am thrilled to announce that I have successfully developed an advanced Machine Learning model for Animal Species Prediction! 🎉🔍

After months of dedicated research, experimentation, and fine-tuning, I am delighted to present my latest project. Using cutting-edge techniques and the power of data, my model accurately predicts the species of various animals based on their characteristics and features. 📊🦁🐼🐦

To make this model easily accessible and user-friendly, I have deployed it using the Streamlit library, ensuring a seamless and intuitive experience for users. With Streamlit, anyone can now interact with the model and witness its remarkable accuracy firsthand. 🚀🖥️

Animal species prediction plays a crucial role in various fields, including wildlife conservation, veterinary medicine, and ecological research. By leveraging the power of Machine Learning, we can gain valuable insights into animal populations, their habitats, and their conservation needs. 🌍🦓🌿

I would like to express my sincere gratitude to the incredible team that supported me throughout this journey. Their expertise, guidance, and enthusiasm have been instrumental in bringing this project to life. 🙏🤝

I also want to extend my gratitude to the open-source community for their invaluable contributions. Collaboration and knowledge-sharing are at the heart of technological advancements, and I'm truly grateful for the opportunity to learn from and contribute to this vibrant community. 🌐🤝

I invite you all to visit my LinkedIn profile to learn more about my Animal Species Prediction project and explore the fascinating world of Machine Learning. Let's connect, share ideas, and work together towards a sustainable future for our planet and its magnificent creatures. 🌱🌎🐾

Idea
The vision behind creating this dataset is to have a data set for classifying animal species. A lot of animal species can be included in this data set, which is why it gets revised regularly. This will help to create a machine-learning model that can accurately classify animal species.

Class Distribution
This is Animal Classification Data-set made for the Multi-Class Image Recognition Task. The dataset contains 15 Classes, these classes are :

Beetle
Butterfly
Cat
Cow
Dog
Elephant
Gorilla
Hippo
Lizard
Monkey
Mouse
Panda
Spider
Tiger
Zebra
